# Covidathon x AskCo19.com
This project is a part of the [Data Science Channel](https://join.slack.com/share/I011SB46KFS/I2lwDnXfX8UPwRRnv2ASM2sW/enQtMTA2MDM3ODIyMzUzNi03ZDlkZDBiZTg2MzdkMGUwN2Y3NGQxOTAzMGNhMDdiYTFlY2YxMDFjOTgzZTQ5ZjNmNDY4M2UzZDdlMWRkYTE3) at [Covidathon](http://bit.ly/hackingcovid19-slackinvite).  Other Covidathon projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/nthopinion/covidathon).

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to collect, validate, and process COVID-19 data into one central repository so that Data Scientists can spend more time running models and building predictions.

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Linear Regression
* Clustering (aka Unsupervised Learning)
* Pattern Recognition 
* Neural Networks 
* Deep Learning 

### Technologies
* R 
* Python
* D3, Plotly, Tableau
* PostGres, MySql
* Pandas, jupyter
* JavaScript
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn

## Project Description
SARS-COV-2 is spreading around the globe at a frighteningly rapid pace. This war continues to hold humanity hostage with fear and social isolation. COVID-19 is one of the greatest threats we have ever faced. The fight against COVID-19 will take place outside of healthcare through the pairing of artificial intelligence and blockchain, utilizing globally connected machines with algorithms that can propagate and move faster than the virus. Our traditional ways of using research, trials, policies, and tried-and-true therapies are not fast enough and have not been able to slow the destruction of COVID-19.

The grassroots open-source team behind AskCo19.com is excited to partner with SingularityNET to merge decentralized protocols, communication technologies, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
